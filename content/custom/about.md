## Hello! I'm Roopesh

Welcome. I hardly develop and occasionally write but when I do, you can find them here.

Hit me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roopeshvs) if you want to have a chat about Cloud & Devops or need guidance on reaching Immortal in Dota 2 or get a random useless fact stuck forever in your head. Here's one:

### Canary Birds & Deployments

Canary Testing/Deployments come from a old British Coal Mining technique involved when exploring mines which often contained poisonous gases like Carbon Monoxide that could kill the miners. The Canaries are good detectors of the colorless, odorless Carbon Monoxide and other poisonous gases because they require a very high amount of Oxygen. If the canary gets ill or dies, the miners get an early warning to evacuate. 

This testing with a sentinel animal before going further into the depths of no return is carried over to canary deployment where major problems that could arise because of a new feature can be captured testing with a limited userbase without production disasters.
